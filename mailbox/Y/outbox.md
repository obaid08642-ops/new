## 2026-11-07 11:3x UTC — Item 1: edge cache #2450 / #2452
Status: in progress
PR: #2450 s/edge-cache (CI: pending after merge of main, df6db36), #2452 s/warmup-404 (CI: pending, was up to date with main)
What changed:
- Merged origin/main into s/edge-cache (clean) and pushed to the same branch. Unit tests in tools/ops/tests pass locally (366 OK for the warmup branch; test_cf_edge_check 4 OK).
- s/warmup-404 needed no merge; I pushed nothing.
- Scheduled task created (hourly, at :17, session-only, auto-expires after 7 days, so it needs re-creating then).
Left / blockers / questions:
- I could NOT run 54-edge-cache-check.sh live: this sandbox's proxy returns 403 for nabd.plus, so `cf-cache-status: HIT` is not proven from here. The branch's earlier note (S_STATE.md) records 10 of 10 within 4 asks from a previous session; please verify on your side.
- Waiting for CI on both, then item 2 (OCR off Replicate).
